  <a>Jack Ma: Early Life and Education</a>
  <small>
    <ul>
      <li>Jack was born to parents, who were involved in a profession of storytelling through music, on the 10th of September, 1964. The place of his birth was Hangzhou city located in the Zhejiang Province of China.</li>
      <li>Since a really young age the lad was very keen on gathering knowledge about English and tried his best to communicate better in the language. His passion to be a better speaker used to even drive him to a hotel located near his residence, which was frequented by foreigners.</li>
      <li>The youngster even started guiding tourists in visiting sight-seeing places around the city. The motive was to spend more time with native English speakers in a bid to gain a command over the language.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, Ma also aspired to enrol in a university and even attended exams for the same reason, but remained unsuccessful. He then joined the ‘Hangzhou Teacher’s Training Institute’ to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in English. Jack graduated from the institution in the year 1988.</li>
